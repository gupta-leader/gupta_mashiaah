A Monument for Peace,"In December, 1864, the Civil War was nearly over. The armies of the Union had conquered most of the South, but the fighting was not finished. Hoping to reverse the war's course, the Confederate general John Bell Hood marched his army toward Nashville. The capital of Tennessee, Nashville, had been under Union control since 1862. Capturing it, Hood hoped, could save the Confederacy.

It was freezing cold when the battle started on December 15th. The Confederate troops were outnumbered. They fought in ragged uniforms, sometimes without shoes. Against the superior Union army, they had no hope. On December 16th, Hood was defeated. The war was over.

The Union won the Civil War four months later. Although the Southern states returned to the Union, the country remained divided. Fifty years later, most of the war's veterans were dead. Around the country, towns and cities had begun building monuments in their memory. In the North, monuments were built to honor the Union. In the South, monuments honored the Confederacy. Even though the states were united again, no one built a monument to both sides.

In 1914, Mrs. James E. Caldwell and her group, the Ladies Battlefield Association, began raising money to build a monument for those who died in the Battle of Nashville. They hired Italian sculptor Giuseppe Moretti to design a statue. They raised money by hosting balls and asking local businesses for donations. By 1927, they had enough, and the monument was completed.

Moretti's statue showed a young man standing between two horses. Behind it, a tall white obelisk was built, with an angel at the top. ""No guns, no swords, no trappings of war mar the peace-like beauty,"" Mrs. Caldwell said. It was not a war monument, but a peace monument.

The structure was special because it honored all those who died in the war—no matter which side they fought for. Built less than a decade after World War I, it was also dedicated to the American soldiers of that conflict.

In 1974, a tornado knocked the 40-foot-tall obelisk to the ground, where it shattered to pieces, along with the angel at its top. Moretti's sculpture was damaged, but it was repaired. The city did not have the money, however, to build a new column. A few years later, an interstate was built beside the monument, blocking it from view, and making it hard for anyone to get to it.

For two decades, the monument was alone—out of sight and nearly forgotten by the public. In 1992, the Tennessee Historical Commission chose a new location for the monument, inside a small park near the original battlefield. Again, fundraising was necessary—to move the statue and construct a new obelisk.

The original statue cost $30,000 in 1927. To move and restore it would cost much more—some estimate more than $500,000. But after seven years of work, the money was collected, and the statue was rededicated—with a brand new obelisk to go with it. Finally, Mrs. Caldwell's monument was whole again, and the message of peace could be seen once more.

The Brooklyn Bridge,"Have you ever seen a picture of the Brooklyn Bridge? This is a famous bridge in New York City. It connects Brooklyn and Manhattan. Those are two parts of the city. 

How does the Brooklyn Bridge stay up? Big stone towers and big steel ropes! Big ropes go between two towers. More steel ropes hang from those big ropes. The roadway hangs from these ropes. 

The Brooklyn Bridge also has a web of steel ropes on each side. These make the bridge extra strong. That’s good, because many people and cars go across it every day!"
Pluto: The Planet That Wasn't,"Poor Pluto!

It’s bad enough to be the runt of the group, but to be told after 75 years that you’re not even a member of the club - what an insult!

Pluto was first discovered in 1930. Until 2006, students were taught that it was the ninth and smallest planet in the solar system. Smaller than Earth’s moon, it is not even as wide as the United States.

Pluto is made up almost entirely of rock and ice. It is so far away that it took the NASA New Horizons spacecraft over 11 years to get there from Earth. Pluto’s full orbit around the sun lasts almost 250 Earth years!

But as small as it is, as cold as it is, as far from the sun as it is, for all those years it was considered the ninth planet of the solar system... until Eris came around.

Eris was discovered in 2005. It is about the same size as Pluto. And like Pluto, it is part of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of objects that circle the outer edge of the solar system.

After Eris was discovered, scientists had to make a decision. Either Eris was the 10th planet in the solar system or it was not a planet at all! And if Eris weren’t a planet, could Pluto be considered one?

Scientists made new rules for what is counted as a planet, and decided that neither Pluto nor Eris qualified.

A new category was created: dwarf planet. The official list of planets in the solar system went from nine to eight, and Pluto and Eris became members of the dwarf planet club. So long for Planet Pluto—but at least it no longer has to be the littlest guy in the club. In fact, Pluto is one of the bigger dwarf planets! Maybe Pluto doesn’t have it so bad after all."
When Television Became Colorful,"Today, nearly all television programs are broadcast in color. If you turn on a baseball game, you can see that the grass on the field is green, or that the pitcher has a blue cap on. But when your grandparents were children, most people watching TV at home could not have seen any of those colors. Television programs were broadcast in black and white only.

Television sets that could broadcast in color have been around for a long time. An engineer named John Logie Baird invented a color TV set in the 1930s. But the picture on Baird’s TV flickered, and was not clear. Companies would not sell a TV that was not good quality.

For many years, people worked to improve how color televisions worked. Over time, companies found ways to make the picture clearer. The improvements also meant that a user could turn a dial to add just the right amount of color to the picture.

By the late 1960s, many people were buying color televisions. Soon, most TV shows were being broadcast in color, and most people in the U.S. had color TV sets.

Today, it’s unusual to find any television show that is still broadcast in black and white. Now the world of television is full of color!"
An Unlikely Parasite: The Mistletoe,"During the holidays, many people hang mistletoes over doorways. People share kisses under this evergreen plant. It is a popular Christmas tradition. But don’t let the image of a romantic plant used during the happy times of the holidays fool you. In the forests where they’re from, mistletoes can do some real damage. Let’s take a look at how and why.

The mistletoe plant is evergreen. This means it has leaves that remain green throughout the year. It is also poisonous and has white berries and small, yellow flowers. The mistletoe lives on other plants, taking water and nutrients from these plants. For this reason, mistletoes are considered parasites. The white berries of the mistletoes contain seeds. Some birds and mammals like to feed on these berries. When they do, the seeds may attach to the animal eating the berries. The animal may carry the seeds to another part of the tree or shrub. They may also carry the seeds to another plant altogether. The seeds start to grow roots that dig through the bark of the tree or shrub. The roots grow into the tissues of the plant they’ve taken over. That’s how mistletoes take nutrients and water away from the host plants. Mistletoe can be hard to remove once it infects a plant. The best way to fight off a mistletoe infestation is to cut off the infected branch completely. If the mistletoe takes over more parts of the plant, it can start to weaken the plant and make it harder for it to grow.

As mistletoes grow in the trees, they become a thick mix of branches and stems. This big mass is sometimes called a “witch’s broom.” Some animals nest in these witches’ brooms. These animals include chickadees, house wrens, and most Cooper’s hawks."
Predicting the Future,"Garry Golden sits in a small cafe in Brooklyn, New York. In front of him, sheets of paper with diagrams litter the table. He rapidly sketches trains, cars and highways as he explains his ideas. Garry Golden has one passion: transportation. The science of how to move people from place to place fascinates him. He spends his days studying the relationships between cars, subways, and trains. But he’s most excited about imagining the way these relationships will change in the next 20 years.

Golden is a futurist. Futurists are scientists who analyze the way the world is today and use that information to make predictions about what the world will be like in the future. In this way, they are the opposite of historians, who try to better understand the present through studying the past. Futurists hope that by making scientific predictions about the future, we can make better decisions today.

Some futurists study the environment. Some study human society. Golden focuses on the study of transportation. He earned his graduate degree in Future Studies from the University of Houston. Living in Houston for those two years changed the way he viewed transportation in the United States.

Many public transportation advocates dislike Houston. They argue the city is too sprawling (it can take more than three hours to drive from one side of the city to the other during rush hour) and that there aren’t enough buses and subways. However, Houston was a source of inspiration for Golden.

“Houston is a really interesting place, and their transportation is a fascinating story—it’s worth watching. When you think about it, what is the U.S. like? It’s more like Houston. So you need to understand how Houston approaches things to understand the country as a whole. New York City is the exception,” said Golden in an interview with The New York Times.

Golden points out that people in New York City own fewer cars and walk much more than anywhere else in the United States. “It’s a unique environment,” says Golden. “Very different from the rest of the country.”

However, Golden believes American cities will become more similar to New York City in several ways over the next 20 years. He sees a trend toward fewer cars in the future. He explains, “Cities have a cost of car ownership that is a challenge. All these vehicles cost the city: in services, in having to repair roads and all of the other things.” Cars also take up a lot of space. Houston, for example, has 30 parking spaces for every resident. That’s 64.8 million parking spaces in only one city.

Golden points out that having so many parking spaces is inefficient. Much of the time the parking spaces sit empty. At high-use times—for example, Saturday afternoon when everyone is running errands—every parking space at a shopping center is full. But at 3 a.m. on a Monday, no one is at the shopping center. What is the solution? “I think cities are going to start to legislate cars in very new ways,” says Golden. He explains that cities will make new laws to limit the number of cars people can have within city limits. Instead, people will use taxis, subways and buses. New technology, like smartphones, can make these forms of public transportation even better.

Buses have the same problem of inefficiency as parking spaces, explains Golden. Sometimes they are full, and sometimes they are empty. But imagine if everyone had a smartphone and used them to signal when they wanted to ride the bus. Buses could change their route, depending on who wanted to ride.

How soon would these changes come? Golden admits that it will take several years. Cities can be slow to change. Also, new systems of transportation can be expensive. “But it’s coming,” he says. “The trend of the empowered city will be here soon.”

The other trend that excites Golden is electric cars. “We need to reduce the amount of fuel we consume,” says Golden. “Everyone agrees on this. The question is how to do it.” Golden especially believes in the future of electric cars that have sensors to understand the world around them. “If we have cars that can communicate with one another, they can adjust speeds to eliminate traffic jams,” he says. Rush hour in Houston would suddenly be much less painful.

One challenge related to the production of electric cars is that it is hard to cheaply produce batteries that are strong enough for these cars. This is partially because cars are so heavy. But Golden argues you could also make cars out of strong plastic composites. The cars would then be much lighter and much cheaper to make. “This could revolutionize the highways,” he says. When could electric smart cars become the norm? Golden argues as soon as 2030.

As a futurist, Golden shares his predictions with other scholars at conferences across the country. He also provides advice to companies that want to know what the future will be like so that they can make better strategies. Golden remains optimistic about the future. “There are so many exciting developments,” he says. “In thirty years we will live a very different world.”"
Benjamin Franklin: The Ultimate Solution Creator,"Benjamin Franklin is credited with an array of inventions and accomplishments. Among these are the repeal of Britain’s Stamp Act, bifocals, the lightning rod, the Franklin stove, the reform, and creation of the original U.S. postal system. All are notable for being solutions, in the 1700s, to everyday problems faced by Franklin’s peers or to bigger social and political issues (like the American colonies’ lack of representation during Britain’s rule).

When faced with some kind of roadblock or trouble, Franklin was particularly adept at finding a way around it. Beyond his keen intuition that facilitated his discoveries and solutions, Franklin had an exceptional intelligence. This was evident in the way he approached problems—the man was famous for being economical, community-driven, and supportive of education and hard work. He didn’t come from a wealthy family and was well known for living simply, yet smartly. Partly because of this straightforward, but thorough approach to daily life, he was better able to invent and create or improve solutions to some of the era’s problems.

Take, for example, the trouble of having two different kinds of poor eyesight. Most people have only one vision problem, at most, and during Franklin’s time, eyeglasses to help nearsightedness or farsightedness already existed. Some people, however, experience both kinds of vision deficiencies, whose scientific names are presbyopia (farsightedness) and myopia (nearsightedness). To address both at the same time, Franklin created dual-lens eyeglasses, which offered a bottom half to correct one’s vision of close-by objects and words, and a top half enabling the same viewer to see far away. He did this by cutting the two different necessary lenses in half and combining them. This solution also made it possible to tailor the prescription of each lens to accurately correct the vision of the wearer.

It’s not a perfect system; to this day, even if bifocals have improved, new users can experience headaches or dizziness when first wearing them. However, those in need of bifocals typically acclimate to the two-lens system (and in 1955, an optician named Irving Rips further refined the solution, by creating seamless bifocals from one lens, improving upon the original design). The glasses meet their wearer’s vision needs.

Franklin also addressed common problems. During his lifetime (1706-1790), fireplaces and stoves were the only way to heat one’s home. Burning wood or scrap produces smoke—not always what you want filling your house! To combat the issues of much smoke filling homes and inefficient heating, Franklin created a new system, called the Franklin stove. Essentially, it was an improved fireplace, meant to offer more heat and less smoke than the fireplaces that came before it. To do this, Franklin put something called a baffle (a hollow duct through which cold air entered and hot air exited, warming the room) at the back of his stove. The baffle was open at the bottom and had two holes at the top. Cold air sinks and hot air rises, so the underside of the baffle was meant to take in cold air from the room, heat it with the fire’s flames, and release the heated air back into the room. Franklin’s other adjustment was the attachment of an inverted siphon to the baffle. This inverted siphon was a U-shaped duct that he thought would carry smoke away from the room and up a chimney.

Interestingly, Franklin’s stove wasn’t particularly successful. It addressed two of the main heating problems of the day—inefficiency and an excess of smoke—but it didn’t actually work that well. The inverted siphon only functioned correctly if the fire burned consistently, a factor that couldn’t be guaranteed. However, given the problems and the way people built their homes in 1741, when Franklin invented his stove, the equipment he came up with is viewed as a solution that addressed the problems he was concerned with.

Besides dual-purpose eyeglasses and a less smoky fireplace, Franklin is also credited with inventing the lightning rod. This is perhaps his most famous invention, and with good reason. Before it, lightning striking one’s home could have disastrous consequences, especially since houses were generally made from wood. The invention came about as a way for Franklin to test a hypothesis. He believed that lightning was related to electricity—a common piece of knowledge now, but new in 1750, when he invented the lightning rod.

By understanding that lightning tended to hit the highest, nearest point, Franklin determined that putting a rod on the top of a building meant lightning would be more likely to hit the rod than the house itself. Franklin’s lightning rod connected to a wire that ran down through the house and into the ground, where it was attached to a ground rod. Both rods were made from metal, which Franklin theorized would conduct the electricity of the lightning. By moving from the first rod down the length of the wire, the lightning’s energy could be safely transmitted into the ground, where it would no longer pose a threat to one’s home or body.

Franklin didn’t just deal with objects as solutions to problems. He was the first known creator of a “pros and cons” list, which is an invention to assist with decision-making. In a 1772 letter to a friend, he laid out how he made difficult decisions: he divided a piece of paper into two columns, with one headed “pros” and the other “cons.” He would think about the pros and cons of a particular decision for several days, writing them down whenever they came to him. When no more occurred to him, he would go through each side of the list, assigning a weight to every point. Then he would strike out a pro for every con. At the end, he would see if the balance was on one side or the other, think about the problem for another day, and then make a decision.

This kind of systematic approach to decision-making was probably quite useful for Franklin’s overall approach to making scientific inquiries, which he applied in his research too. For instance, he was very interested in population growth, particularly in the American colonies. In the 1700s, the colonies’ population was exploding, but no one knew by how much. After studying the growth for several decades, beginning in the 1730s, Franklin published “Observations on the Increase of Mankind"" in 1755. This essay explained that rapid population growth usually accompanied an abundance of food supplies. At the time, the Americas had the fastest population growth anywhere in the world and also had a huge amount of farmland, which meant they could easily nurture a growing population. Besides enlightening his readers as to why the colonies were experiencing a surge in citizens, he was also able to explain how much their area was growing. At the time he published “Observations on the Increase of Mankind,” based on his two decades of observation, Franklin theorized that the population of the Americas was set to double every 20 years.

During his lifetime, Franklin was also put in charge of systems affecting the population as a whole. He tended to improve them. In 1775, he was appointed the first Postmaster General of the American colonies. When he began the job, a letter traveling from New York to Philadelphia could take two weeks, even though the distance was only 109 miles. To get a letter safely overseas, a sender would send copies on several different ships, with the hope that at least one of them would make it to the recipient. Post offices were very informal—they could be anything from a town’s inn to its local pub.

As Postmaster General, Franklin instituted several solutions that made sending and receiving mail faster and more reliable. First, he toured all the major post offices and the routes connecting them, so he could learn more about the system as a whole. Based on his observations, he dictated more direct routes between these post offices and had milestones set up on the roads used by mail carriers, so they could more easily follow the correct path. (Roads were very poorly marked in the 1700s.) Second, he specifically improved service between New York and Philadelphia, the colonies’ two biggest, most important cities, by having the mail wagon travel between the cities during the night, as well as the day. Thus more mail was able to travel faster. Lastly, he instituted a standardized chart for mail that made clear what it should cost to mail a letter or package, based on its weight and how far it was traveling.

In an unusual move, Franklin never patented a single one of his designs or inventions, which meant other people were free to copy them, improve upon them, or re-create them. He resisted hoarding his ideas because he truly believed that people benefitted from one another’s inventions. It gave society an advantage if new designs and inventions were available to all, because that way, more minds could work on them in order to make them better. By coming up with devices and systems that addressed certain problems, but refraining from trademarking his inventions, Franklin paved the way for others to continually improve on his initial solutions."
Alexander Graham Bel,"Alexander Graham Bell was in his laboratory, working on a device that would allow people to talk to one another through wires, even when they were not in the same room, or even the same city. Today, we take for granted that we can communicate in real time with people around the corner and around the globe. But in the 1870’s, when Bell was experimenting with his new project, such an idea was like a fantasy.

On March 10, 1876, that fantasy came to life. It is unclear what exactly unfolded that day, but one story says that while working on his voice transmitter, Bell accidentally knocked over a bottle of transmitting fluid, burning his skin. Instinctively, he called out to his assistant, Thomas Watson, to come help: “Mr. Watson. Come here. I want to see you.”

Watson heard those words and was startled. They had come crackling across the earpiece of what the two inventors had labeled the telephone. The experiment was successful. It was the first telephone call.

Alexander Graham Bell’s interest in communications devices traced back to his childhood in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was born on March 3, 1847 to a father who was an expert in speech production and a mother who was a gifted pianist despite being profoundly deaf. The perseverance and success of his mother in the face of such adversity taught young Alexander that problems were surmountable and that he could help people to overcome them.

From a young age, Alexander’s curiosity propelled him to find solutions to problems. When he was 12 years old, he came up with his first invention. While playing in a grain mill with a friend, he was frustrated by the lengthy time it took to remove the husk from the wheat grain. He went home, thought about it, and created a gadget that used rotating paddles and nail brushes to strip the husk off the grain. It was the first of dozens of varied devices that Bell would invent.

Bell’s curiosity and ingenuity were nurtured by his grandfather, a teacher of speech and elocution. When Bell was 15 years old, he went to live with and care for his grandfather, who was aging and ailing. The two grew very close, and the grandfather encouraged Alexander to pursue his inventive streak.

In 1870, the Bell family’s life changed rather abruptly when they moved to Canada. Bell’s two older brothers had died of tuberculosis, and Alexander’s health had been failing, too. His parents were convinced that America would be a healthier environment and moved, first to Ontario, Canada, then to Boston. Bell thrived. His health improved. Eventually, he began to tutor deaf students in Boston.

The parents of two of his students were excited by Bell’s idea to invent a device that transmitted multiple signals over a single wire. One of the parents learned, however, that another inventor, Elisha Gray, was working on a very similar project at the same time. To encourage Bell and to help rush his work along, the parent hired an electrician by the name of Thomas Watson to be Bell’s assistant. He hoped that between Bell’s clever ideas and Watson’s practical skills, the two men would succeed quickly. However, instead of focusing on a multiple-signal transmission device, Bell and Watson focused much of their time on a device to transmit the human voice over wires. To protect their experiment, Bell and Watson’s voice-transmitting device was registered with the United States patent office. Lewis Latimer, another inventor, helped Bell by drafting the drawings of the device for the patent. The patent was well timed: Gray attempted to file for his own “telephone” the very same day, but he was turned away because the idea was already protected and owned by Bell and his supporters.

On that March morning in 1876, Bell’s dream was achieved when the words “Mr. Watson. Come here. I want to see you” traveled from the room Bell was in to the room Watson was in across telephone wires. The two men took their incredible telephone device on the road, demonstrating its proficiency in city after city. The year after his telephone came to life, Bell married Mabel Hubbard, one of the deaf students whose fathers supported Bell’s dream of inventing the telephone.

Bell was challenged dozens of times in lawsuits by people trying to discredit his patent, especially by other inventors who claimed to have invented the telephone before him. He won every time. Bell created the Bell Telephone Company, and in the first 10 years of its existence, telephone ownership in the United States grew to more than 150,000 people. Bell improved the device over the years. For example, he added a microphone that amplified the voice. He also went on to invent and patent many other devices that would have pleased his mother because of the way they helped people to solve problems.

When Bell died on August 2, 1922 in Nova Scotia, Canada, the entire telephone system was shut down for one minute in tribute to the man who revolutionized communications.

Louis Braille,"Have you ever noticed when you step into an elevator that next to the buttons showing the floor numbers, there are small plates with a series of raised dots and bumps? Did you ever wonder what those bumps and dots mean and why they are there? When you run your fingers over those plates, you feel the ridges. When blind people touch them, they read the floor numbers. In a grid of six bumps, with two across and three down, a configuration of two raised bumps across the top and one down on the right side is the number 4; one dot on the top left side and two across the middle is the number 8.

Who invented this elaborate setup of bumps and dots that comprise an entire alphabet and numerical system that allows blind people to read with their fingers? Was it a distinguished scientist, or a brilliant author, or perhaps a famous artist?

Actually, this system, which is called braille, was created by a blind 12-year-old French boy and was named for him. Louis was not always blind. He became blind by accident. Louis Braille was born on January 4, 1809 in a small country village near Paris called Coupvray. His father was a leather worker who made harnesses and other leather goods. One day, when he was just three years old, Louis was in his father’s leather workshop. Like many young children, Louis enjoyed imitating his father. He was fiddling with an awl, a small tool with a round wooden handle and a sharp, pointed metal tip that is used to punch holes in leather. While he was playing, the awl slipped and poked Louis in the eye. A doctor treated the wound as best he could and patched the eye. But the eye became infected, and the infection spread to the other eye. Within a short time, young Louis was totally blind in both eyes.

In those days, many blind people became beggars or performers in sideshows. But Louis’s parents refused to allow their son’s disability to get in the way of his studies or his life. Louis attended school like his brothers and sisters, relying on his creativity, intelligence, and drive to overcome obstacles. To help him navigate the village, his father made him canes. The local priest taught him to use his other senses to learn: his hearing to distinguish the calls of different birds, and his sense of smell to identify different plants and flowers. Louis was one of the brightest students in his school.

In 1819, at age 10, Louis earned a scholarship to attend the Royal Institute for Blind Youth in Paris, the first school in the world devoted to blind children. For Louis, going to the school meant leaving his family and the village he knew well, where he felt safe. But Louis and his family knew the school offered him the best opportunity to get an education and lead a successful life. There he excelled in studying history, math, science, and grammar, but he proved especially gifted at music. Louis became an accomplished pianist and organist. He even got a paid job as an organist, playing in a small church near the institute.

The students at the school learned most of their subjects by listening to lessons. But there were a few books that the school’s founder, a man named Valentin Hauy, had developed by printed raised, or embossed, letters. Reading that way was slow, and the books were large and heavy. But they were the only books available then for blind people. Louis Braille began to wonder: wasn’t there a better way to allow blind people to read?

One day Louis learned about the work of a former French army captain named Charles Barbier. Captain Barbier had invented something called “night writing,” a code of 12 raised dots and dashes that allowed soldiers to communicate with one another at night without using lights that would alert the enemy to their location. The soldiers could “feel” the messages with their fingers, and keep safe. The code turned out to be too complex for the soldiers, but it inspired Louis Braille. Louis simplified the system, reduced the series of dots from twelve to six and eliminated the dashes. By the time he was 20, Louis published his first alphabet for the blind, a system he continued to work on and perfect.

And how did Louis create the dots he used in his revolutionary new system? He used an awl. The very tool that caused his blindness became the instrument that brought the opportunity for reading to Louis and generations of blind people to this day.

The world was slow to accept Louis Braille’s innovation. Indeed, during his lifetime, his method was not widely accepted. Louis Braille died at the young age of 43 from tuberculosis, a devastating respiratory disease. He was buried in his home village of Coupvray.

In time, Braille’s method became accepted around the world. “Braille” alphabets were created in languages spanning the globe. Today, we find them not only on elevator plates, but also on computers and cell phones. And the name Louis Braille stands for innovation, courage, and determination."
The Origins of the Internet,"All of the men were nervous as they waited. But Len Kleinrock was the most nervous. The year was 1969, and just over 20 people were crowded into the room. A group of pale men in their 20s and 30s, the computer scientists stood beside executives from big telephone companies. The men tapped their feet impatiently. They waited.

The computer itself loomed along the wall, 15 feet wide and 35 feet long. A long grey cable snaked from the computer to a smaller machine, the router or “switch,” in the corner. The two machines were important, but the real reason the men had gathered was the activity happening in that long grey cable. They were about to see whether information could successfully flow between a computer and router, for the first time in history.

At the center of the group was Len Kleinrock, the 35-year-old star of computer networking. Kleinrock was a professor at UCLA and was the one who had engineered this system. “Everybody was ready to point the finger if it didn’t work,” said Kleinrock. “Happily, the bits began to flow from the host to router. I like to refer to that day as when the Internet took its first breath of life, first connected to the real world. It’s like when a baby is born and has its first experience of the outside world.”

For Kleinrock, that moment had been almost a decade in the making. He originally became interested in the problem of network connection while working on the East Coast. He recalled, “I looked around at MIT and Lincoln Laboratories [sic]: I was surrounded by computers and recognized that one day they’re going to have to talk to each other. And it was clear that there was no adequate technology to allow that.”

At the same time that Kleinrock was growing absorbed in the problems of network connection, the United States government was ramping up its investment in science and technology research. The Soviet Union’s famous launch of a satellite called Sputnik had been an embarrassment for the United States—the United States thought that it should be the leader of space travel. Eisenhower created a branch within the Department of Defense to ensure that the scientific leadership of America wouldn’t be eclipsed again in the future. This new organization, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), became one of the major engines of technological innovation throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1962, while Kleinrock was finishing up graduate school, ARPA created a new department devoted to computer science. The head of this division was J.C.R. Licklider, a fellow scientist at MIT who also worked on network structures.

“He was one of those visionaries who foresaw the advantages of combining humans with computer,” said Kleinrock of his former colleague and boss. “He created a concept called man-computer symbiosis, recognizing that if you put the two together, you could get very significant results.” Licklider ran into political problems at ARPA and ultimately left to return to MIT, but not until he had planted the idea of networking as a concept worthy of funding.

Bob Taylor took over ARPA’s computer science division in 1966 and reinvigorated the project. Taylor had been funding different projects in computer science departments at universities across the country and realized it was growing too costly to give each department the machines and resources to do every task. What he needed was a way for geographically far-flung research centers to somehow share each other’s computing resources. Taylor needed to create a network. The man he brought in to build it, Larry Roberts, happened to be Kleinrock’s old officemate at MIT.

“We were all intimately familiar with each other’s work, so when they asked, Roberts said, ‘Look, I know exactly what this technology should be, and I know it can work. Len Kleinrock has already proven it,’” recalled Kleinrock. “And bang, the project came to life. After a number of years, it came to action.”

And so it was that all of the men were crowded into the room watching a long grey cable. An air conditioner hummed in the background, fighting against both the heat outside and the heat generated by the massive machine in the room. Cheers broke out when they saw that the information was flowing, but the real test was to come a few weeks later.

The first message between two computers was sent on October 29, 1969. This time the room was empty, except for Kleinrock and one other engineer. They didn’t know that it was such an important milestone, so there was no camera or tape recorder. The two men were trying to log onto a computer at the Stanford Research Institute and successfully got through two letters of the message “login” before the system crashed.

“It was not until this thing called the Internet hit the consumer world that we recognized this network was really important. At that point we looked back and said, ‘What was the first message ever sent on the Internet?’” Kleinrock remembered. “Samuel Morse sent, ‘What hath God wrought?’ Alexander Graham Bell said, ‘Come here Watson I need you.’ Neil Armstrong had his giant leap. These guys were smart and they understood media. We had no such concept, but the message we created, ‘lo,’ [short for ‘login’] that’s the most prophetic, succinct, powerful message we could have come up with by accident.”

Native American Conflicts,"Prior to European settlement in North America, Native American tribes populated specific areas of the continent. Their cultures, food, traditions, and beliefs were wrapped up in their environment. Plains Indians, for instance, hunted buffalo and used the entire animal for food, clothing, shelter, kitchen goods, and other important materials. Though it is believed that Native Americans engaged in battles between tribes prior to European settlement, the presence of the Europeans helped spawn conflicts and circumstances that would dramatically impact the lives of Native Americans across the continent.  

Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Europeans sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in hopes of settling new land and obtaining resources. North America seemed like a dream: lush forests, plenty of freshwater lakes, the promise of gold (even though it would be a long time before gold was actually found), and new uncharted lands lured European explorers to the continent. They brought along with them crops and new technology. They also brought along diseases that caused the deaths of many Native Americans. The arriving settlers had grown immune to such diseases because those particular diseases had been in Eurasia for over five centuries. Native American tribes had not built up immunity to these infections, including smallpox. Some estimate that during smallpox epidemics in North America, 80 to 90 percent of fatalities were part of the Native American populations.

There were many instances when Native Americans traded in peace with the Europeans. The Native Americans made good use of some of the technology the Europeans brought, like metal tools. The Native Americans often exchanged food or rights to hunting lands. However, wars would break out often due to disputes over deals between the Native Americans and Europeans.

In Jamestown, Virginia, for instance, European settlers found themselves in peaceful times with Native Americans when they were able to make agreements. Though the settlers, who founded Jamestown in 1607, had to depend on the Native Americans for some food and resources, they also typically viewed the natives as people who should be conquered. When hard times came for the settlers in 1608 and many of them did not have much food, they pressured the natives into giving them food. These aggressions began a slew of conflicts now collectively called the Anglo-Powhatan Wars, which lasted several decades with thousands of Native Americans either dying or being displaced.   

The consequences of European arrival to North America negatively affected the relationships even between Native American tribes from time to time. Native Americans were suddenly scrambling to share resources with whole new groups of people who had access to powerful weapons, technology to build sturdy buildings, and the ability to call for reinforcements from thousands of miles away. The relationships Native American tribes had built with each other became tenuous as the mounting pressure coming from European settlers threatened to destroy their ways of life. This sparked many skirmishes between tribes over hunting land that was becoming more and more scarce as Europeans continued to settle further into the West. At this time, land was both currency and livelihood. If tribes were forced off their lands, they needed to either find somewhere else to go, or learn to live with the Europeans who had taken over and assumed power, which proved impossible much of the time.

An Unlikely Parasite: The Mistletoe,"During the holidays, many people hang mistletoes over doorways. People share kisses under this evergreen plant. It is a popular Christmas tradition. But don’t let the image of a romantic plant used during the happy times of the holidays fool you. In the forests where they’re from, mistletoes can do some real damage. Let’s take a look at how and why.

The mistletoe plant is evergreen. This means it has leaves that remain green throughout the year. It is also poisonous and has white berries and small, yellow flowers. The mistletoe lives on other plants, taking water and nutrients from these plants. For this reason, mistletoes are considered parasites.The white berries of the mistletoes contain seeds. Some birds and mammals like to feed on these berries. When they do, the seeds may attach to the animal eating the berries. The animal may carry the seeds to another part of the tree or shrub. They may also carry the seeds to another plant altogether. The seeds start to grow roots that dig through the bark of the tree or shrub. The roots grow into the tissues of the plant they’ve taken over. That’s how mistletoes take nutrients and water away from the host plants. Mistletoe can be hard to remove once it infects a plant. The best way to fight off a mistletoe infestation is to cut off the infected branch completely. If the mistletoe takes over more parts of the plant, it can start to weaken the plant and make it harder for it to grow.
As mistletoes grow in the trees, they become a thick mix of branches and stems. This big mass is sometimes called a “witch’s broom.” Some animals nest in these witches’ brooms. These animals include chickadees, house wrens, and most Cooper’s hawks."
Short Circuits,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, consider the amazing shrinking transistor! Watch it contract a million times until it becomes a tiny dot visible only under a powerful microscope!

We all know that technological progress is not an actual magic show. Still, it almost seems like magic the way the transistor, the main component in all modern electronics, has diminished in size since being invented in 1947.

The first transistor, made of gold, plastic, and germanium (a metallic crystal), was about the size of an adult’s fingernail. Today’s transistors, etched on silicon wafers, can’t be seen with the naked eye. The minimum size of a transistor is now 45 nanometers. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter—roughly the width of three or four atoms.
Computer engineers are trying to make transistors even smaller. How tiny can they go?Every transistor has the same basic properties: It can both conduct and stop the flow of electricity. The word transistor is a combination of two words: transfer and resistor.

All transistors are made from materials called semiconductors. A semiconductor is a cross between a good conductor (such as copper) and a good insulator (such as rubber). It can be made to accept or reject the flow of electrons in a circuit. Germanium, used in the first transistors, is a semiconductor. So is silicon, widely used today.

A transistor’s ability to control the flow of electricity has made possible our entire computerized world. All computers depend on the binary system to convert electric signals into useful information. The binary system has only two numbers: 1 and 0. When a transistor allows electricity to flow through, it registers a 1. When the transistor stops the flow of electrons, it registers a 0. Millions or billions of those 1s and 0s, flashing off and on hundreds of millions of times a second in programmed patterns, enable your computer to do everything it does—from allowing you to play World of Warcraft to letting you type up a school science report.A transistor that is only a few atoms wide is incredibly small. But researchers want to make transistors even smaller and cheaper to produce. Chip-making technology has run into a big problem, however. Transistors smaller than 45 nanometers and etched on silicon chips don’t work very well. They tend to leak electrons, making them less efficient.To get around that problem, scientists are using nanotechnology to look at new materials and new methods to produce transistors. Nanotechnology is the engineering of materials on the atomic level, building new materials from the bottom up by manipulating atoms and molecules.One promising area of nanotechnology is the use of graphene, a carbon fabric that is only one carbon atom thick. Graphene is strong, stable, and can act as a semiconductor. If researchers can find a practical way to etch transistors onto graphene, smaller and immensely faster computer chips can be more cheaply made.

“[The ultimate goal] of electronic engineers is the so-called ballistic transistor,” physicist Andre Geim, a graphene researcher at the University of Manchester, told LiveScience. “It would be very, very fast, ultimately fast, in fact.”

Another promising area of nanotechnology research involves using strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to build transistors. DNA is the genetic material that determines the makeup of all living cells. Researchers can now take strands of DNA from bacteria and manipulate them into almost any shape they want. California Institute of Technology researcher Paul Rothemund has helped pioneer that technique. He has twisted DNA strands into smiley faces and maps of North and South America. Rothemund coined the phrase DNA origami, after the Japanese art of paper folding.

Rothemund and others are looking to shape DNA strands into a kind of scaffolding that could be attached to silicon wafers to make transistors. Because DNA does not conduct electricity, scientists are experimenting with ways to combine DNA with atoms of conducting materials, such as gold, to build transistors. DNA replicates (copies) itself. So if researchers can produce a DNA transistor, all they have to do is add the right “soup” of chemicals, and the DNA would reproduce itself, making millions of new nano-sized transistors at little or no cost.Making transistors much smaller and much more cheaply could transform our lives. Tiny, smart nanomachines could do any number of things quickly and invisibly. Their greatest use might be in medicine. Swallowed in a pill or injected, tiny, computerized “nanobots” might be able to repair damaged cells one at a time, restoring health invisibly and painlessly before destroying themselves.

The nanobots might repair pipes, bridges, airplane engines, and electrical equipment too. They might even help with housework. Kris Pister, a University of California physicist, envisions what he calls smart dust—nanobots that move around the house at night, eating dirt and generally cleaning up.
Such things are possible in your lifetime—all because scientists are now “thinking small.”"
Political Parties,"Do you know what a political party is? It has nothing to do with birthdays. A political party is a group of people who have similar ideas about what the government should do. They work together to elect people of their party into government office.

The United States has two big political parties. One is the Democratic Party. The other is the Republican Party. Many other, smaller parties also exist.

Political parties in the United States nominate, or choose, the people they want to elect. Once those people are chosen, party members work to win votes for their candidates. Party members want their candidates to be the ones making laws and the ones carrying out those laws.

The Democratic Party is the United States’ oldest political party. It began nearly two hundred years ago. Democrats who became president include Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

The Republican Party began in the 1850s. It was nicknamed the “Grand Old Party,” or GOP. Republican presidents have included Donald Trump, George W. Bush, and his father, George H.W. Bush.Many Americans are members of a political party. No one has to be a member of any party to vote in an election, however. In the end, the voters decide which candidates get elected."
Happy Trails,"The morning she left for Camp Kanawa, Maria awoke with a lump in her throat and an ache in her stomach. She had gone on plenty of sleepovers. She’d even spent a whole weekend at Aunt Jolie and Uncle Ed’s. So why was she so nervous?

No breakfast today, she thought, imagining the ache turning into nausea and a horrible road trip after a full meal. Then the smell of French toast wafted upstairs. As usual, Maria’s stomach grumbled as soon as the French toast-scented air hit her nostrils. On the other hand, maybe a good breakfast is exactly what I need.

She gave her arms and legs a good stretch and ambled downstairs.

“There’s my big camper!” her mom said, squeezing Maria’s shoulders with one arm the way she did when she wanted to give a hug, but was in too much of a rush for a full embrace. She walked briskly to the stove, placed two pieces of French toast on a plate and tapped a canister above them, powdered sugar snowing down.

“Just like you like it: super fluffy, slightly crispy...”

“…and lightly dusted,” said Maria, already in position, armed with knife, fork, napkin and full glass of milk.

Maria poured a puddle of maple syrup beside the toast and topped each piece with a little mountain of whipped cream.

“Get started while it’s hot. Your father’s coming down in a minute. I told him to shave. Don’t want the grizzly bear—I mean, grizzly beard—to send your new bunkmates running for the woods.”

“Okay, okay,” Maria’s dad said with a sneaky smile. “Clean as a whistle. Just like you ordered.”

“Just like I ordered?”

“The mustache stays. Admit it, you love it.”

Maria’s mom shrugged.

“I think it’s hip,” Maria said, dipping a bite in some syrup.

“Well, your old man is hip,” her dad said, moving his head the way he did when he wanted to look like a cool surfer dude but looked more like an Egyptian robot.“In fact, I was the most popular kid at my camp.”

“For the record, it was science camp,” Maria’s mother reminded her, “and his rise to fame was thanks to what was known as The Great Explosion.”

“Accident or genius? The world may never know,” Maria and her dad said in unison, using their deepest, most mysterious voices. They slowly broke out of character and into laughter.

“In all seriousness, Maria, popularity is not important,” her mother said, looking her straight in the eyes. “Finding the people who like you for you—that’s what matters.”

“Your mom speaks the truth, Sugar,” said Maria’s dad, wiping his thick mustache with a napkin. “Just be yourself. You’ll have a blast.”

*                      *                      *                      *                      *                                             

Just be yourself. Just be yourself. Maria repeated the words like a mantra as she sat with her new cabin mates in a circle on the grass.

“Cool bracelet,” said the skinny, freckled redhead sitting next to her.

“Thanks. I made it in an embroidery class I took this winter.”

“Whoa! That’s impressive. Can you teach me how?”

“If you teach me how to do a braid just like the one in your hair. I’ve mastered the art of French toast eating, but definitely not French braiding.”

A loud whistle hushed the girls’ laughter and buzzing all around them. They looked up to see a beautiful older girl blowing into an acorn top between her thumbs. Her skin was tan and eyes were dark brown, like Maria’s.

“Hello! I’m Audrey, one of your two cabin counselors.”

“And I’m Gina, your other cabin counselor,” said the pale girl with curly, brown hair and eyes that were icy blue in color, yet warm. 

“And you ladies are the Dragonflies!” Audrey lifted her arms in the air as she announced it.“Each cabin here at Camp Kanawa is named after a different insect.”

“The Cockroach boys—age twelve and thirteen like you—think they’ve got the best mascot. I beg to differ. Dragonfly girls are as tough as dragons and graceful as…well, dragonflies.”

“That sounded better when we rehearsed it,” Gina said lightheartedly.

The ache in Maria’s stomach had officially turned into butterflies—the excited kind."
Important People,"The janitor is the person who helps keep the school clean. Every morning students come from all over and walk into the school building. A building can get dirty, especially when a lot of people go into it. The janitor sweeps and mops the floors so that the dirt brought in gets cleaned up.

The teacher is the person who runs the classroom. The teacher helps you learn about different topics and gives you assignments. If you don’t understand something, you can ask the teacher for help.

The principal is the person who is in charge of the whole school. The principal is the leader of the school. The principal is in charge of all the teachers at the school. The principal is the person whom parents call when they want to talk to someone about the school. The principal usually sets high expectations for the students and makes sure that learning is happening in the school.

American schools are in a city or town. The city or town has a leader, too. The leader is usually called the mayor. The mayor is in charge of running the government of the city or town. The mayor works with the people in the city or town and the other people in the government to fix the problems of the city or town. The mayor has a lot of responsibility.

An American city or town is located within a state. Just like a city or town has a leader, a state has a leader, too. The leader of a state is called the governor. An American state is a part of the United States. There are 50 states, and each one has a governor. The person who is the leader of the United States of America is called the president. There have been over forty presidents throughout the course of America’s history. The first president of the United States of America was George Washington. Who is the current president?"
Crossing the Finish Line,"Running a marathon is not easy. It takes hard work, practice, and patience. After all, to run a marathon, you have to run 26.2 miles by foot! Think about it this way: 26.2 miles is the same as running the length of a football field more than 460 times. It takes most people four or five hours to finish. In 2013, the world’s fastest marathon runner finished the race in 2:03:23. Imagine running for over two hours without a break!

By the age of 30, Lea Tambellini had run more than five marathons and had no plans to stop. She had always been an athlete. When she was in high school, she swam on her school’s swim team and ran to stay healthy and active. Her mom and dad ran marathons, and when she was 22, they helped her train for her first marathon.

Lea’s first marathon took place in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was called “The Flying Pig.”

“I was very nervous,” she said, “but I had my mom there, so that helped.”

Running the race was hard, but the hardest part was when she ran past a cookie factory and smelled cookies at mile 18. “I just wanted to be done,” she said. “I was spent, but my mom kept me going. It was already her 15th marathon.”

The word “marathon” comes from a Greek legend. In the legend, a brave soldier ran all the way from the battlefield of Marathon to Athens, Greece to tell everyone the Greeks had won the battle against the Persians. It is said that he ran the entire way without stopping—a distance equal to a modern marathon.

Today, thousands of people run marathons every year. Runners train for months to get ready. To prepare for one of the marathons, Lea ran four to five times every week. On weekdays, she completed shorter runs, five or six miles at most. But on the weekends she ran long distances–13 miles, 15 miles, and 20 miles!

“I don’t mind training because I get excited about working toward something. And I love running with a group of friends and working toward the goal together. But it does take a lot of time.”

Running a marathon is a great achievement. “It’s a great feeling of accomplishment and nothing feels as wonderful as reaching my goal when I cross the finish line,” Lea explained. “I can’t wait for the next one!”"
Focus: What's Inside,"Why is the brain so mighty? It has billions of neurons (nerve cells) to carry out its commands. Without the brain, you would not be able to think, feel, move, remember, or do all the things that make you the special person you are.

At birth, the brains of infants weigh the same. But by adulthood, that changes. The average male brain weighs about 11 to 12 percent more than a woman's brain. But brain weight and size have nothing to do with intelligence. What matters is what's inside the brain.

Despite its small size (about 3 pounds), the brain is able to receive and send an unlimited number of messages. It does this with the help of the spinal cord, the sense organs, and the autonomic (automatic) nervous system. The brain carries out this task by assigning jobs.

It puts the cerebellum (sair-ah-BELL-um) in charge of balance and coordination.
The brainstem regulates heartbeat, breathing, and blood pressure.
And the largest parts of the brain, the cerebral cortex (suh-REE-brul CORE-tex) and the cerebrum (suh-REE-brum), control thoughts, feelings, and actions.
The cerebrum is divided into two halves. Each controls the muscles on the opposite side of the body. So if you usually eat with your right hand and kick with your right foot, then your brain's left half is said to ""dominate,"" and you're right-handed. When the opposite is true, your brain's right half takes the lead and you're left-handed.

People use both halves of the brain, but the left half is especially good at helping you with words and numbers and helping you read and speak. The right side is better at creative tasks, such as music and art. And your sense of humor develops there.

Each half has four sets of lobes (sections). The frontal lobes behind your forehead do a lot of the thinking and planning. The parietal (pa-RYE-ih-tul) lobes toward the back of your head sense pain. And the occipital (ock-SIP-ah-tul) lobes at the base of the brain allow you to see. The temporal lobes behind your ears store memories of music, taste, vision, and touch."
Escape from the Mountains,"Four kidnapped climbers face danger in a far-off country.

Four mountain climbers hung 1,000 feet above the ground. They were sleeping on tiny cots dangling from the side of a cliff.

That's when the shots rang out.

""They're shooting at us!"" yelled Beth Rodden. Rodden, at age 20, was one of the world's top woman climbers.

On the ground, three soldiers waved at the climbers, yelling, ""Come down, now!""

The four Americans had scaled many dangerous mountains. But nothing had prepared them for this trip.A Foreign Land
Rodden and her boyfriend, 22-year-old Tommy Caldwell, were climbing with Jason Smith, 22, and John Dickey, 25. They were in a country called Kyrgyzstan (KURG-i-stan). It is located in central Asia.Rebel soldiers there want to form their own country. Still, the area the climbers were in was thought to be safe.
The rebel soldiers took the climbers prisoner. The rebels hoped that they could trade the climbers for food or weapons.For days, the climbers and the rebels hiked through the mountains. Government helicopters flew overhead. The rebels hid the prisoners under sticks and dirt so that they couldn't be seen from the air.The climbers each ate half an energy bar per day. They drank muddy water. They tried to sleep in the freezing cold.The climbers hid as rebels traded gunfire with government soldiers. ""We were terrified,"" Rodden said. ""We knew we could die in a firefight, shot by either side.""But,"" she added, ""we kept talking about what we could do to escape.""On the sixth day, the batteries in the rebels' walkie-talkie died. The leader said he and others would return to the climbers' camp to get fresh ones. He left one man to keep the prisoners on the move.

The group crept along a cliff over a 1,500-foot drop. ""[The guard] was having a hard time getting around,"" Smith said. ""He stopped, and someone yelled, 'Now!' Then we pushed him off.""
The guard's arms and legs thrashed in panic as he fell toward a river below. ""I don't think anyone could survive a fall like that,"" Smith said. ""No. Nobody could.""The climbers ran for the government's army camp. They ran for 18 miles. As they neared the camp, rebels began shooting at them. Government soldiers shot back. ""We're Americans!"" Smith yelled. ""We're Americans!""Moments later, the climbers were safe in the camp. Soldiers lent them clean clothes. The climbers described their ordeal.Seven months have passed since the four Americans were captured. Today, all four are climbing again. But they also must deal with what they had to do to escape.""It's hard to think about that,"" said Rodden about the guard who was pushed to his death. ""But we were afraid we wouldn't survive. We'll have to live with it."""
White Out,"A strange fungus continues to attack the country’s bat population.

Recently, bats with fuzzy white noses have popped up in Indiana, Ohio, Maine, North Carolina, and Kentucky. It’s an ominous development. White-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease that kills hibernating bats, has officially spread into five more states.

The mysterious syndrome was first discovered in the state of New York in 2007. From there, it spread across the United States and Canada. Infected bats can now be found in 16 states and four Canadian provinces.Scientists have learned a great deal about the disease since its discovery. There’s much they don’t understand, though, including how to stop it. “There’s a lot of work still being done,” says Tom Kunz, a bat expert at Boston University.

Time is of the essence. More than a million and perhaps as many as 2 million bats have died already, Kunz says. “We’ve got a disease that is causing one of the most precipitous declines of bats in American history,” he says.

Skin and Bone

White-nose syndrome is named for the white fungus that typically appears on the muzzles and other body parts of infected bats. Initially, scientists weren’t sure whether the fungus caused the disease. Many suspected it was an opportunistic infection—a secondary infection that gains a foothold in an animal already weakened by another illness.

Researchers haven’t found any other infectious agents in the sickened bats. So most now agree that the fungus is the likely cause of WNS. The fungus is new to science, and researchers have named it Geomyces destructans.

“We still haven’t determined how the bats are actually dying from the fungal infection,” says Jeremy Coleman, the national WNS coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. One clue: Infected bats seem to run out of fat in the middle of winter. Bats need that fat to nourish themselves until spring. Without it, they die.Normally, hibernating bats wake briefly once or twice a month, Kunz says. Infected bats arouse from hibernation every four or five days. They then expend valuable calories flying around. That activity probably explains why the bats are so skinny. “Every arousal burns up body fat,” he says.

What makes infected bats wake up so often? Some scientists have proposed an “itch-and-scratch hypothesis.” Just as people scratch their toes like crazy when they have athlete’s foot, a common fungal infection, bats might feel a similar itch when the fungus invades their skin. The uncomfortable sensation could be rousing them from their winter naps.

Then again, the bats might just be thirsty. One of skin’s many jobs is preventing water loss. In bats, healthy wing membranes help maintain a water balance in the body. The fungus damages bat wings, causing small holes and scar tissue to appear in the membranes. Bats could be losing excess water through their injured wings, some scientists propose. The animals might be waking up to find a drink and avoid dehydration (an excessive loss of fluid).

Fungus Among Us

The fungus G. destructans is itself puzzling. Hundreds of other species of Geomyces fungi live in U.S. caves but don’t bother bats at all, says Coleman. And though G. destructans has been found in caves in Europe, bats there appear unaffected by it. Do European bats possess a gene that makes them resistant to infection? Is European G. destructans somehow different from the strain found in the U.S.? “We’re trying to figure out why this fungus is so devastating for [North American] bats,” Coleman says.Meantime, the best hope for North America’s bats seems to be preventing any further spread of WNS. The disease is thought to spread from bat to bat, says Coleman, but researchers haven’t ruled out the possibility that people are spreading it too. The Fish and Wildlife Service has played it safe and closed a number of caves to human visitors. “We’re trying to prevent people from moving the fungus faster than the bats can,” Coleman says.

So far, WNS has been found in nine bat species, including two endangered ones: the Indiana bat and the gray bat. As more states and more species are affected, the impact of WNS could snowball. Bats play an important role in their ecosystems. A bat can eat half its weight in insects every night. A female bat that’s lactating (feeding her pups with milk) can gulp down twice that amount. Insect-eating bats in the U.S. save farmers at least $3 billion a year by swallowing bugs that would otherwise damage crops, according to an analysis in the journal Science. WNS is just beginning to move into the Midwest, the nation’s agricultural heartland. “As it continues to spread, we could see an agricultural impact,” Coleman says."
Peer Pressure Power,"Going along with the crowd doesn’t have to be a risky move.

Ever done something you didn’t want to do, just to fit in? Or just because your friends wanted you to? That’s peer pressure. And just about everyone feels it at one time or another.

Peers are people your age, such as your friends, who have experiences similar to yours. Your peers influence your decisions and behavior every day, and they can push you to make bad choices, even dangerous ones. But is peer pressure always bad?

Positive Spin on Peer Pressure

“Peer pressure can sometimes be a good thing,” says Ian Brennan, cocreator and one of the writers of the TV show Glee. That show dealt with the issue of peer pressure all the time, through the experiences of musical kids in a not-so-popular high school chorus. “Friends can give you the courage to try something you normally wouldn’t, like a new sport or auditioning for the school play,” Brennan points out.

Nicole S., 16, of Edmore, N.D., used to be afraid of singing in front of people. One time, her friends convinced her to sing karaoke with them. She ended up having fun! “Now I will sing anywhere, even with people present. Positive peer pressure helped me face my fear,” she says.

Pressure’s On!

You are surrounded by your peers all the time, and you learn a lot—both good and bad—by just being around them. You might admire a star athlete. Maybe you notice the popular kids at school and look up to them. Those aren’t necessarily bad things. The popular group could be really nice; the athlete, a hard worker. Being inspired and influenced by different peer groups could help you in the long run.

The people around you can also be negative influences, however. Maybe a star teammate tells you never to pass the ball to a certain player, or a popular student cheats on tests or sends mean texts. Should you try to be like them to fit in?

Peer Pressure Is a Fact of Life

“It’s not a matter of if peer pressure is going to happen,” says Lee Erickson, coordinator for the Northern Lights Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD) group in North Dakota. “It’s a matter of when.”

“The main thing is not to compromise who you are,” Erickson continues. “The kind of coolness and popularity you think you may get by joining the crowd and doing risky stuff is temporary. Your character is with you for the rest of your life.”

Nicole agrees. “My motto is be who you are, not who others want you to be,” she says.

Peer pressure is powerful, but the ability to choose is yours. If a situation feels wrong, there’s a good chance it is wrong. Think about what’s best for you—and what you’ll say or do—before you’re in a sticky situation. “No one has tried to get me to smoke or drink yet, but I know there will come a time,” says Schuyler W., 13, of Seattle. “The thing is, I know I don’t want to do it, so when it does happen, I’m just going to stick up for myself and say no.”

Make pacts with your friends to stay away from risky situations together and to support one another when the going gets tough. Talk with your parents about ways they can “bail you out” if you need to save face with your peers. (For instance, if someone asks you to hang out after school and you think there might be drinking or drugs around, you can tell them your parents need you to come home right away.)

Should You or Shouldn’t You?

Standing up for yourself and saying no isn’t always easy. But you might give voice to a bunch of peers that feel the same way you do. It can take just one person to speak out and change a situation. According to Erickson, “People will respect you for standing up for yourself—even if it doesn’t seem like it right away.”

“If friends try to get you to do something that you know in your heart feels wrong,” says Glee’s Brennan, “tell them exactly how you feel. And if they’re not cool about it, find new friends.”

That can be hard to do, but sometimes it’s necessary. “If your so-called friends are trying to get you to do negative things, do you really think they’re the best of friends?” asks Nicole. “To me, real friends accept you for who you are [and] what you believe in, and respect your decisions.”

Bad News and Good News

“Negative peer pressure gets ahold of us kids really easily,” says Nicole. “Because our friends do it, we’re told something’s ‘cool’ or we’re pressured to try something ‘just one time’ because it won’t hurt.”

Some kids decide to go with the flow regardless of what they know is right. They tell themselves that being popular or being liked is more important than their own sense of self. It doesn’t make sense, but that’s the problem with peer pressure. You can lose yourself. But you can also find yourself, as Schuyler did when he was asked to go camping last year. He really didn’t want to go.

“Sometimes your friends get you to do stuff you don’t want to do, and it turns out great,” he says. “I didn’t want to go camping, but my friends really wanted me to go. Finally, I gave in, and I’m so glad I did. The trip was awesome! We did a lot of fun stuff I would never have done on my own.”

The good news is peer pressure isn’t always something to fear. Your decisions are yours to make. Take the time to make them wisely.

Power Up

Resisting negative peer pressure is a challenge, but it is definitely possible. Here are a few tips for navigating all kinds of pressure-filled situations:

Find real friends who accept the real you. Knowing whom to listen to and whom to avoid is the key to steering clear of negative peer pressure.
Know what to say. “Just say doing that stuff really isn’t your thing,” says Elli L., 15, of North Dakota. “You can also blame your parents—it works wonders.”
Be confident. Stick up for yourself. People will respect you for it.
Think about it. Keep in mind that just one destructive decision can change your whole life, says Nicole S., 16, also of North Dakota. Think: How might this one moment affect how you see yourself?
Getting Real With SADD

Looking to join other kids who want to make smart decisions and avoid negative peer pressure? Check out Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD). It’s a national group, based in middle schools and high schools, that works to save lives by spreading the word about the dangers of risky behaviors such as drinking, using tobacco, bullying, and driving distractedly (including driving while using a cell phone).

SADD is a great resource for kids who are feeling pressured. “It is comforting to know that there are so many people supporting each other,” says Elli L., a SADD member in North Dakota. “We all kind of hold each other up.”“SADD does a lot of awareness projects,” adds fellow member Nicole S. Groups organize awareness days; dances; bowling, pizza and roller-skating events; and more. “We get the word out, but we have fun doing it,” says Nicole.

Young people take the lead in SADD groups. “The kids are in charge,” says regional director Lee Erickson. He works with more than 200 chapters of SADD in South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota. “Our job as adults is to listen, provide support, [and] offer tools and motivation, not to tell them what to do. They can figure that stuff out on their own.”"
Centuries of Peace,"Given the regular outbreaks of religious and political violence in the Middle East, it’s easy to think of Muslims, Jews, and Christians as natural antagonists. This wasn’t always the case, however. For hundreds of years, Muslims, Jews, and Christians lived in peace on the Iberian Peninsula, in what is now Spain. They farmed side-by-side, governed together, and even shared their most important intellectual and religious texts. This collaboration led to the founding of the first modern universities in the West.

But this peaceful collaboration is not what many remember most about the Muslim empire in Spain. What’s most commonly known about the Muslim empire in Spain is its savagely violent beginning and end. After watching for centuries as the Visigoth empire collapsed into corruption and civil war, Muslims in Northern Africa began planning a massive invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. Under General Tariq ibn Ziyad, an army sailed nine miles from Africa to the Rock of Gibraltar (derived from the Arabic “Tariq’s Mountain”) in 711. By 718, Muslims controlled all of today’s Spain and Portugal and part of southern France. This territory was called al-Andalus. Almost 800 years later, the last Muslim leaders were expelled from Spain during a brutal 11-year military campaign that ended on January 2, 1492, when King Mohammad XII surrendered in Granada.

Between these violent bookends, however, thrived a rich and multicultural culture called the Convivencia, or coexistence. While there were occasional outbreaks of violence and repression by Muslim authorities directed against people of other faiths, Christians and Jews were officially labeled “dhimmis,” or protected peoples under Islamic law. A small number of Jews and Christians rose to powerful positions in the government.

People from all three faiths also joined together to share ancient texts that had been preserved by their respective religious teachers. In Toledo and in the empire’s capital of Cordoba, monks and scholars gathered from across Europe and the Muslim world to translate and debate important texts. Perhaps the most important of these scholars was Averroes, who was known in Arabic as Ibn Rushd. Averroes, a judge and scholar, delivered the forgotten wisdom of Aristotle to the rest of the world. He helped rescue ancient Greek philosophy from oblivion, enabling the Muslim empire’s golden age to provide the intellectual backbone later used to build modern Western civilization.

Born in 1126 to a family of prominent civic leaders, Averroes was considered a polymath, becoming a master in Greek and Islamic philosophy, theology, mathematics, and science. He started translating Aristotle from Greek into Arabic after the ruler of the Iberian caliphate asked him to create a version of the text that was clearer and easier to understand than previous translations. Averroes went on to translate most of the known works by Aristotle plus The Republic by Plato and also published many short commentaries on each work.

His work came at an important time. By the 12th century, only a handful of Europeans could still read the works of Aristotle in their original Greek. Few copies of the original survived because they had been written on fragile papyrus, and most versions copied onto more durable and expensive parchment were owned by Islamic authorities. After circulating through the scholastic society of Cordoba, Aristotle’s works were copied and sent across Europe, sparking a resurgence of interest in his philosophy in the West that continues today.

While all this seems very remote, the reasons behind Averroes’s work are just as important today. His best-known original work, “The Incoherence of the Incoherence,” was a defense of the rational mind over religious belief as the root of wisdom and knowledge. Aimed at Islamic leaders who were trying to enact a stricter version of religious law across the empire, Averroes took a risky position, arguing that humans should be the ultimate deciders of law and justice, not God. Five hundred years before writers such as Thomas Hobbs navigated a similar path, Averroes’s positions have caused many to call him the ""founding father of secular thought in Western Europe.” Many of his works were kept at the personal library of the local caliph, or emperor, who was estimated to have collected around 400,000 books, making it one of the largest libraries in the world at the time.

While Averroes argued for greater plurality of world views, the culture of the Iberian peninsula promoted religious equality—or at least some modicum of tolerance—on a day-to-day basis. Jews emigrated from the Middle East and Northern Africa to Toledo and other major cities on the Iberian peninsula, creating some of the most stable and prosperous Jewish communities in the world at the time. It was here that a Hebrew Renaissance flourished, resulting in some of the most important works of Hebrew poetry.

Perhaps the most surprising collaboration between religions during the al-Andalus empire happened inside the mosques, which were shared between Muslims and Christians. This was most apparent at the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba. Founded in the year 600 by the Visigoths as a Catholic church, it was divided by Muslim leaders into Muslim and Christian sections after the Muslim conquest. As more Muslims immigrated to Cordoba and their ranks overwhelmed the building, the emir (ruler of al-Andalus) purchased the other half from the Christians and allowed the Catholics to rebuild churches that had been destroyed during the invasion. Thus began a two-century construction project to enlarge the mosque, which came to include some of the tallest and most ornate indoor structures in all of medieval Europe. The mosque was rechristened as Cordoba’s cathedral when Christians re-took the city in 1236. Three hundred years later, local church leaders proposed to destroy the huge mosque and build a church in its place. But the townspeople were so opposed to the plan they won a rare intercession from the Holy Roman Emperor, second in the Vatican hierarchy only to the Pope, who agreed the mosque should be saved. Today the entire sprawling complex is protected by the United Nations as a World Heritage Site.

Coexistence between Jews, Christians, and Muslims during Islamic control of Spain was not perfect. Jews and Christians were never fully equal to Muslims under Islamic law, and their treatment varied based on changing political and religious decisions of Muslim leaders. But the centuries of Muslim rule were characterized by greater tolerance than anything found at the time in Europe. And thanks to the relative tolerance of the Muslim al-Andalus empire, Western Society rediscovered some of the philosophy and art that would become its foundation."
The Orchid's Secret,"Deep in the jungles of Colombia there is a kind of flower that attracts bees with its unique perfume. The male bees store as much scent as possible from this particular flower on their hind legs. The male bees that collect the most scent attract the female bees to mate with them. In Venezuela there is a flower people collect for its large white or yellow petals. Few people ever find it, though, since it only blooms for a few days. There is a small pink and yellow flower that only grows in a very specific part of the state of Florida. It also only grows on trees, and wind or birds may spread its seeds. These flowers are some of the most rare and delicate species in all of nature. They are all types of orchids.

For hundreds of years orchids have been prized discoveries of collectors and adventurers hoping to find new and exotic breeds of the flower. In her book The Orchid Thief, author Susan Orlean tells how in the 1800s orchids became popular in Europe, which made them very valuable. Many “orchid hunters” set out to find and bring back new types of orchids to sell. However, many of the men who went looking for the mysterious orchids met with tragedy instead. Orlean relates that “dozens of hunters were killed by fever or accidents or malaria or foul play. Others became trophies for headhunters or prey for horrible creatures . . . .” Sometimes orchid hunters even were injured or killed by other people.

On one trip to find orchids in 1901, eight hunters ventured to the Philippines, which is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. A tiger ate one hunter, another was badly burned, and five more completely disappeared. The trip’s only survivor brought back 7,000 orchids. Even modern-day orchid hunters, like Tom Hart Dyke, still face incredible dangers to collect the flowers. He and his partner, Paul Winder, were held as prisoners for over nine months after they were captured on an orchid hunt in Central America.

While the plants have long been valued for their beauty, they may be even more important to science and our understanding of co-evolution. Unlike plants that can self-pollinate, orchids need very specific insects or birds to spread their pollen. The process by which insects, the wind, or birds spread the pollen of different flowers is called pollination.  Pollen is a powder produced by plants that contains their genetic material. In order for the plants to reproduce, the pollen must be physically moved to the flower’s stigma, which contains an egg. Now the fertilized egg can become a seed. Birds and insects can pollinate plants by touching many different flowers and spreading the pollen around.

Orchids evolved to attract insects and birds. Because there are many different species of orchid, there are also many different ways the orchids attract their pollinators. Orlean explains that “many species look so much like their favorite insects that the insect mistakes them for kin [other insects], and when it lands on the flower to visit, pollen sticks to its body…. Another orchid imitates the shape of something that a pollinating insect likes to kill.... Other species look like the mate of their pollinator, so the bug tries to mate with one orchid and then another… and spreads pollen from flower to flower each hopeless time.”

Other orchids don’t use their shape at all, but rather produce specialized scents to attract specific insects, such as bees, beetles or flies. Some orchids smell like cake, some like chocolate, and some like rotting meat. All these smells may seem weird or gross, but they exist to lure creatures to their pollen and help the orchids survive. The strategies to attract insects and spread their flowers’ pollen go on and on. Each family of orchids has a unique kind of insect or bird that visits their flowers, as well as its own way of attracting them. It has worked, too. According to NOVA, a science television series on PBS, “orchid species number more than 25,000 worldwide.” That is more kinds of species than any other flower on the planet, and new ones are still being found.

Orchids and the insects that pollinate them are one of the most amazing examples of evolution. Though their degree of co-dependence varies, as it is apparent that at least some orchids are more reliant on their pollinators than the pollinators are on the orchids, the degree of evolutionary specialization is still very impressive. Research by Harvard scientists suggests that certain species of orchid evolved specifically to attract orchid bees, which collect a wide variety of scents from various plants in preparation for mating. In another case, an orchid mimics a female’s smell and appearance—and the male pollinator gets nothing out of the bargain whatsoever. By tricking the insects that collect its pollen, the orchid has survived since the time of the dinosaurs. Shh! It’s a secret."
The Magic of Mime,"Becky Baumwoll never forgets her lines. That’s partly because there aren’t any lines in the plays she performs. Becky and her theater company, Broken Box, tell stories without using words. They wear white face paint and dress in black. Their plays are performed on an empty stage and without any props. But when the show begins, the empty stage suddenly looks like a desert, a castle, a forest, or a dining room. Without changing her costume, Becky transforms from a wiry old ogre, to a sparrow, to a cup full of Jell-O. Though her hands are empty, she seems to be holding a sword, a can of beans, or the reins of a horse. How can this happen? Are we under a spell? Does Becky know magic?

Becky is a kind of actor called a mime. Ever since she was in college, Becky has been practicing and perfecting her art. A mime tells stories silently and creates objects and landscapes using just his or her body. “If we’re telling a story about fighting a dragon,” Becky explains, “we can’t say, ‘LOOK THERE’S A DRAGON OVER THERE!’ We have to come up with ways to show the audience there's a dragon, by either making one out of mimes like a big moving sculpture, or miming an invisible one.”

It’s not quite magic, but close. Becky and her company of mimes know how to excite the imagination of their audience. The audience's imagination provides the stories with words, props, costumes, and stage sets. “The audience can imagine a more amazing dragon than we would ever be able to describe with words.” Becky knows that everyone has an incredible imagination. Broken Box helps us use ours. Our imagination is where the magic comes from.

Sometimes the mimes are so successful that members of the audience can forget that the props and scenes are imaginary. When Becky was in college, she performed a story about a guardian angel. The angel, who was played by another mime named Tasha Milkman, wants to become a human being, and to do that she has to tear off her wings. “About a week after our performance,” Becky says, “Tasha's friend called her and asked if she could borrow Tasha's angel wings for a project she was doing. She had forgotten they were mimed!”

Some stories are very difficult to tell in mime. “Watching a play in mime is like piecing together a puzzle,” Becky explains. “The audience has to follow every gesture and movement to understand what's going on.” The mimes practice and practice to make all of their movements perfect, otherwise the audience might not know what to imagine. Once, Broken Box performed a play about a fortune-teller at a carnival. They had a great story, but how could they ever get the audience to imagine the carnival? “A carnival is a very specific place. It's busy and bustling, outdoors, big, dirty, bright, and loud.” They didn’t have nearly enough actors to portray all the people in the crowd, and since they couldn’t shout, they couldn’t make the stage very loud. Finally, they found a solution: “We had the main characters walk back and forth on the stage, and every time they walked, the rest of the mimes behind them would make a new group pose around a different carnival act: a strongman, a sword-swallower, and performing sisters.” The audience imagined a bustling carnival full of people. It was so noisy we could hardly hear what the characters were saying!

Though Becky claims to not know magic, she does know how to conjure things out of thin air. Once, when she was very sad, she created a story about a woman who is so sad she can hardly stand. A second mime played the part of the woman’s soul. In the play, the soul tries very hard to help make the woman feel better, pushing her with all her might. Finally the soul succeeds in helping the woman stand. After weeks of working on the performance, Becky started to feel less sad. Creating the performance made her feel better. In a way, mime is magical. “It's like I created my own medicine.”"
A Crooked Election,"Kelly is running for class president of Wright High School. Some of Kelly’s classmates think elections are pointless. Kelly's best friend Maya doesn’t believe in voting at all.

“I’m not voting,” Maya tells her. “Voting is pointless.”

“But if you don’t vote, someone else will. And then they’ll get what they want and you won’t get what you want!” Kelly says.

“I don’t want anything. I just want to be left alone.” Maya responds.

Kelly is running for class president because she says she thinks the school can be better. She wants to see less meat served in the cafeteria and more vegetarian options. She also wants the school to stop bringing a live goat onto the field during football games.

“Kelly has good ideas, but won’t be able to change anything,” Maya tells her classmates. “She’s just idealistic. No one can change anything.”

Kelly’s opponent, Roger, is running for class president of Wright High School because his brother was president last year. In fact, Roger has three brothers, and all three of them have been class president.

“I’m not losing to anybody,” Roger tells his brothers. “Especially not a girl.”

Roger has really nice banners professionally printed and hangs them around the school. Roger’s banners say: “Roger Whitaker. The Right Man for the Wright Job.” The phrase “right man” is a reference to the fact that Kelly is a girl. Roger says that girls can't be president because they cry too much. He only says this secretly to his brothers. He would never admit this opinion to his classmates.

“All Kelly cares about is that we have tofu in the cafeteria,” Roger tells his classmates. “But I want to fix the broken doors in the bathroom!” Roger holds up a screwdriver as he says this and makes a grunting “man” sound.

The election banners were given to him as a gift by the Harrison kids. Their dad owns Harrison Sign Manufacturers and made the signs for free. 

“Just make sure that when you get elected—and we are confident that you will—you tell the school that they need new signs.” They shake hands and give him the free signs, which suddenly don’t seem so free.

Roger looks around the school and sees that they do, in fact, need new signs. The exit sign above the main door is cracked. The sign above the library just says “Librar.” The menu next to the school cafeteria is so old it says you could get a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for 50 cents.

So, maybe it is a bit unfair to take something from a student who’s going to vote for you. But Roger figures they have a good point about the signs.

Meanwhile, Kelly has been running around the school putting up signs of her own. They are all handmade from construction paper with fresh flowers on them. They say, “Make the school beautiful. Vote Healthy for Kelly.”

Maya tells Kelly they look nice, but she doesn’t think they’ll do anything.

“It’s just lipstick on a pig,” she says. “Just because you make it look nice doesn’t mean it’s not still a pig.”

Kelly’s handmade signs make Roger nervous, because they seem more honest and down-to-earth. Although his signs are really nice and professional, it’s also obvious that they cost money. Roger feels like the students don’t relate to him.

He wants the other students to think he’s just like them, so he organizes a barbecue during school lunch hours with free hot dogs. Actually, it’s the Harrison brothers’ idea. They even get him a deal on the hot dogs, from their cousin’s supermarket, of course.

A few kids come by, but Roger also notices that a good amount of students stay in the cafeteria, eating food they brought from home. He can’t figure out why someone would want to eat a stale sandwich when he’s offering free hot dogs.

The hot dog giveaway is definitely a flop. Roger goes home dejected and sad.

The next day, the school holds a debate between the two candidates. The debate is moderated by their civics teacher, Mrs. Graham.

Roger and Kelly sit on stage, opposite each other. The auditorium is filled with students, all of whom will have the opportunity to vote. All the students are watching with great interest, as this is how they will make their decision. One wrong answer today and it could mean losing the presidency.

Mrs. Graham asks the first question.

“As class president, how would you see fit to spend the school’s extra money?”

Kelly answers first. “Well, I certainly wouldn’t be spending our money on expensive signs and hot dogs,” she says.

The audience gasps. This is a low blow. It’s surprising that Kelly would say something like that.

Roger looks into the audience and sees the Harrison brothers sinking down into their seats.

Kelly continues, “I would like our school to be healthier, and I know we have many students who are vegetarian. They don’t have many options for lunch, and if they forget to bring lunch from home, sometimes they don’t eat lunch at all!”

At this, at least 50 students stand up and applaud. Even Maya stands and applauds, although she rolls her eyes a little, too. The other students join in the cheering.

Of course, a few students start booing, just to be jerks.

“Eat more bacon!” says one, cupping his hands around his mouth so the sound will carry.

“Eat a vegetarian!” says another, laughing and throwing pieces of paper.

“Okay everyone, that’s enough!” the moderator says from stage. The students who are booing the vegetarians just look like troublemakers now.

Roger looks into the audience. He finally realizes how many students are vegetarian; he has never thought to find out before.

“What about you, Roger? What will you spend money on?”

“Well, I would like to have a new sign for the cafeteria,” he says. “And that could certainly include any vegetarian options that the school may end up providing.”

“Oh please! Without me to push for it, the school will never change its menu,” Kelly says. “Roger offers empty promises. And he thinks he is better than me because I’m a girl!”

The students start to applaud and Roger watches the Harrison brothers sneak out the back door.

When the debate is over, Roger can tell that he lost. His failure is palpable; he can feel it. Students clamor around Kelly in a group, hugging her and telling her how they can’t wait for the new lunch menu.

Only a few people come up to Roger.

“I liked your nice sign,” says Peggy, pushing her glasses up on her nose and squinting.

“Thanks,” said Roger. “Can I count on your vote next week on election day?”

“Oh, that,” Peggy says. “Well, actually, I’m voting for Kelly. I just wanted to be nice to you.”

After school, the Harrison brothers are waiting outside to talk to Roger. He notices they are carrying some of Kelly’s signs.

“We’re going to have to withdraw our support,” Boyd Harrison tells him.

“We just don’t think you look like the winning candidate,” Trent Harrison says. “And we really need to get behind someone who can help bring our dad more business.”

“What are you talking about?” Roger says, angrily. “I was your guy! You supported me! I thought we were friends.”

“Yeah, friends. Well, about that…You see, it’s just that Kelly will bring in a lot more business for our dad’s company,” says Trent.

Boyd nods in approval. “It’s nothing personal. You’re a nice dude and all. But Kelly has a little more…spirit.”

“Kelly? Oh please!” Roger is yelling now. “Her signs are all handmade! Didn’t you see them? It’s just hipster junk!”

“Oh, yeah, you noticed that? We went for a more ‘indie’ feel with these.” Trent says.

“Tried to make them look handmade.” Boyd interjects. “The hipsters love that. We’re glad you noticed.”

Kelly is coming out of the school now, and the Harrison brothers walk away from Roger without saying a word. Each brother puts an arm around Kelly.

“How’s our best girl?” they ask.

Kelly smiles. “Doing just great now,” she says. “Now that Roger looks like a woman-hating meat-eating loser.”

“We’ve got this election in the bag,” Boyd says. “A vegetarian bag, that is.”

Trent holds up a bag of veggie burgers. “We’ve even been eating these at lunch, showing all those health-conscious kids that we’re one of them.”

“Well, you sure do look trustworthy now, don’t you?” Kelly says, laughing. “But do you have any real food? I’m so sick of this vegetarian junk. My stomach is killing me!”

“You bet we do,” says Boyd. “In fact, we have a whole bunch of hot dogs left over from Roger’s barbeque yesterday. Let’s go to our house and have dinner.”

“By the way,” Kelly says, “How did you convince people not to go get delicious free hot dogs? I think he could have really turned people to his side with that.”

“It was easy,” Boyd says. “We started a rumor that Roger left the hot dogs out in his car overnight. Nobody wanted to get sick. He was so depressed; he just left everything sitting there. We grabbed all the leftovers and took them back home.”

“That’s brilliant,” Kelly says. “I can’t thank you enough!”

“Well, you won’t have to thank us once you’re elected. Just make sure the school uses our dad’s business. And, oh yeah, when the cafeteria goes vegetarian, you know which veggie burgers are the best choice.”

Boyd dangles the bag in front of her and, for the first time, she reads the label: “Harrison’s Burgers.”

“Victory has never tasted so sweet,” Kelly says.

"
Renewing America,"Excerpt from President Bill Clinton’s First Inaugural Address (1993)

When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold, news traveled slowly across the land by horseback and across the ocean by boat. Now, the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously to billions around the world.

Communications and commerce are global; investment is mobile; technology is almost magical; and ambition for a better life is now universal. We earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with people all across the Earth.

Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world, and the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy.

This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who are able to compete and win in it. But when most people are working harder for less; when others cannot work at all; when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises, great and small; when the fear of crime robs law-abiding citizens of their freedom; and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead—we have not made change our friend.

We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps. But we have not done so. Instead, we have drifted, and that drifting has eroded our resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence.

Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths. Americans have ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people. And we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us.

From our Revolution to the Civil War, to the Great Depression, to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.

Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our Nation, we would need dramatic change from time to time. Well, my fellow Americans, this is our time. Let us embrace it.

[. . .]

To renew America, we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home. There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic—the world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race, they affect us all.

Today, as an old order passes, the new world is more free but less stable. Communism’s collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers. Clearly America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make.

While America rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges, nor fail to seize the opportunities, of this new world. Together with our friends and allies, we will work to shape change, lest it engulf us.

[. . .]

But our greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in many lands. Across the world, we see them embraced—and we rejoice. Our hopes, our hearts, and our hands, are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom. Their cause is America’s cause.

The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today. You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus. You have cast your votes in historic numbers. And you have changed the face of the Congress, the Presidency, and the political process itself.

Yes, you, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring.

Now, we must do the work the season demands.

To that work I now turn, with all the authority of my office. I ask the Congress to join with me. But no President, no Congress, no government, can undertake this mission alone.

My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal.

I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of service—to act on your idealism by helping troubled children, keeping company with those in need, reconnecting our torn communities. There is so much to be done—enough indeed for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service, too.

In serving, we recognize a simple but powerful truth: We need each other. And we must care for one another.

Today, we do more than celebrate America; we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America:

An idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge;

An idea tempered by the knowledge that, but for fate, we—the fortunate and the unfortunate—might have been each other;

An idea ennobled by the faith that our Nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of unity;

An idea infused with the conviction that America’s long heroic journey must go forever upward.

And so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st century, let us begin anew with energy and hope, with faith and discipline, and let us work until our work is done."
Is the Earth Getting Warmer?,"In 1975, a scientist named Wallace “Wally” Broecker wrote a paper in which he asked a simple question: was the Earth getting warmer? When the paper was published, some of Broecker’s colleagues laughed at him. Many of them believed that the world was actually cooling.

Historically, there have been periods in which the Earth’s temperature has slowly risen and cooled over thousands of years. This is a natural process that can be caused by many factors, including changes in radiation from the Sun, changes in the Earth’s orbit, and volcanic activity.

However, climate change can also be caused by changes in the amount of certain gases in the atmosphere. Broecker had noticed that the amount of carbon dioxide – a colorless, odorless gas -- was slowly building up. While some carbon dioxide is produced through natural processes, large quantities of it are also produced by humans. Carbon dioxide is generated in especially large amounts when we burn fossil fuels, such as oil, coal, and natural gas. This burning happens when we drive cars, use electricity, and make certain products. When released into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide traps heat. Broecker reasoned that if people produced a lot of carbon dioxide, then enough heat would be trapped that the Earth would begin to warm. He called this “global warming.”

Several decades later, many climate scientists agree with Broecker: the Earth is heating up and humans are largely responsible. This warming process is often referred to as “climate change.” More carbon dioxide is being produced than ever before. Every year, humans produce about 8 billion metric tons of carbon. 2012 was the hottest year in recorded history. Recently, scientists estimated that more carbon dioxide exists in the atmosphere than has in over three million years.

While scientists understand how climate change works, some of its effects are still difficult to predict. Some scientists expect an increase in so-called “extreme weather” events, such as hurricanes and floods. Others foresee a rise in levels of sea water. While exactly what changes will happen are unclear, Broecker has warned that people should be prepared for some large disturbances. In an interview with the Guardian, a British newspaper, in 2008, he compared the Earth’s climate to a wild animal. Sometimes, when provoked, the animal will react violently and unpredictably.

""If you're living with an angry beast, you shouldn't poke it with a sharp stick,"" he said.

Why are scientists able to understand some phenomena, like climate change, in a general way, but aren’t able to predict the changes they will have on the Earth? Part of the reason is because many large Earth systems involve “feedback loops” – processes that help amplify (positive feedback loops) or diminish (negative feedback loops) certain changes.

Feedback loops can occur in the climate system, too. If the temperature of the Earth rises, it can change the environment so that it produces even more heat.

There are a number of different ways in which this phenomenon occurs. Scientists who work in the Arctic, at the northern end of the Earth, have been reporting that, every year, more and more floating sea ice melts. In the last 30 years, more than one-third of the ice that appears in the Arctic during the summer has melted away.

This worries scientists because Arctic ice plays an important role in cooling the Earth – although not in the way you might think. While we add ice to our drinks to make them colder, Arctic sea ice cools the Earth in a different way. Ice, which is white colored, reflects light. This means that much of the sunlight that hits ice bounces off and is sent right back to space. Reflecting light away helps keep the Earth cool.

However, as the Earth heats up, ice begins to melt. As ice melts, this reveals more of the darker-colored land or ocean water, which doesn’t reflect heat, but absorbs it. So, less light is reflected back into space, causing the climate's temperature to increase. As the world gets hotter, this causes the ice to melt even faster. This increase in temperature causes still more ice to melt, which causes the world to get hotter, etc… This is an example of a positive feedback loop, in which heat produces more heat.

Similarly, there are other climate systems that can get caught in feedback loops. There are many gases that, like carbon dioxide, contribute to global warming. Some of these gases are trapped in the frozen tundra across Alaska, Canada, Russia, and other northern lands. This soil, whose temperature is below freezing, is called permafrost. When permafrost melts, much of this gas is released into the atmosphere. This causes the atmosphere to warm up, which melts more permafrost, which heats up the atmosphere, etc… Again, a feedback loop ensues, in which a warm climate leads to the creation of an even warmer climate.

A more complex example of a similar phenomenon involves the Amazon rainforest. When temperatures rise, the rainforest experiences more droughts and wildfires. This causes more trees to burn down. Just as when humans burn fossil fuels, the burning of trees causes large amounts of carbon dioxide to be released into the world. Trees play two important roles in preventing global warming: they help absorb carbon dioxide, which prevents it from trapping heat in the atmosphere, and rainforest trees help pump water into the atmosphere. When trees burn down, less water is pumped into the atmosphere, which leads to less rainfall, which leads to more trees burning – which leads to more carbon dioxide being produced. These are both examples of positive feedback, but feedback can be negative too. When negative feedback occurs, an original effect is diminished.

Both positive and negative feedback loops can occur in all kinds of Earth systems, not just in a system related to the climate. For example, the relationship between different species of animals is a kind of system as well. Periodically, the populations of certain animals will wax and wane. In some cases, the population of a species can become stuck in a negative feedback loop. This can occur if a predator becomes too powerful and its prey becomes too weak. For example, in the early 19th century, humans began hunting a species of bird known as passenger pigeons. Soon, fewer birds existed, which made it more difficult for the species to mate. As mating declined, fewer birds were born, which made it still more difficult for the birds. This created a negative feedback loop in which the population of the birds continued to fall until they are now extinct.

While scientists understand some of how these feedback loops work, they lack a deep knowledge of them, making them extremely unpredictable. This is because, like any complex system, these feedback loops include many variables. Many of these systems are also interdependent, which means that many of these feedback loops affect each other. For example, when permafrost melts, it makes the whole world hotter, not just the area around the permafrost. And these changes are not just limited to temperature. Changes in the amount of rainfall an area receives can lead to changes in its atmosphere. This, in turn, can affect the Earth’s temperature, which can affect how much ice melts, which can affect how much rain falls, and so on. So, a small change to a very complex system can lead to very big consequences. This makes predicting the behavior of large systems incredibly difficult.

Some skeptics about climate change point to this uncertainty as a way of casting doubt on whether the world is actually warming. However, being unable to predict the effects of climate change does not mean that it is not happening. Think back to Broecker’s analogy. If you poke a wild animal with a sharp stick, you may not be able to guess exactly how it will react. However, even if you don’t know precisely what the animal will do – it may bite you or scratch you or just growl – it’s still a very bad idea to provoke it.

Scientists continue to debate exactly what happens as the Earth’s temperature rises. Among the most popular ideas are that dry areas will become increasingly dry, while wet areas will become increasingly wet; oceans, seas, and lakes will rise; and glaciers, ice caps and snow-covered areas will become smaller. However, many climate scientists agree that a potential way of reducing the effects of climate change is to cut down the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere."
What's for Breakfast?,"Of course Dad decided to blame me when he came downstairs this morning to make coffee and burn toast, and saw the mess in the kitchen and the living room. “DANIEL,” I heard him from my post in the bathroom. I stood there on my toes to see what I’d look like if I were taller, brushing my teeth and wondering if I could get out the door with un-brushed hair, and without Miranda, my older and snottier sister, noticing.

“DANIEL!”

I came downstairs still wearing my pajamas and saw a bunch of magazines on the rug by the couch, toppled over from their usual stack on the coffee table. Then I saw the bad mess in the kitchen. The jars with Miranda’s baking supplies are usually lined up along the counter, but one of them was on the floor in pieces, and there was flour everywhere. Dad was standing in the middle of it, wearing half of a suit: shiny black shoes and pressed work pants, but no shirt; and his hair still wet from the shower. I laughed. That was a mistake.

“Did you do this, funny man?” The coffeemaker sounded like it was gargling mouthwash. I guess Dad wasn’t so mad that he couldn’t make his java.

“No, Dad, I didn’t.” It was the truth, too. When I turned off the TV the night before, the magazines were still stacked. And when I got my nighttime cup of water from the kitchen, there was no flour on the floor.

“Really? Because we’ve had this problem before, with footballs and jump ropes, and indoor kite-flying.” Dad obviously did not believe me.

“Really, Dad, I have no idea how this happened. I got some water in the middle of the night, but everything was clean then.”

Dad turned around and got some bread and butter, and honey. The toaster sounded like it hurt when he pushed the lever down. It was old and never made toast right. I only ate toast when I slept over at other people’s houses. Dad didn’t really care what his toast tasted like, I guess.

“I don’t have time to clean this up, Daniel, and I’m mad. Go upstairs and get ready for school.” Dad filled a big bowl with water.

“Okay.” I was halfway up the stairs when Miranda’s cat, Oatmeal, shot up underneath my legs. “DAD!” I yelled. “I BET IT WAS OATMEAL!”

I don’t think Dad heard me, but I got dressed and the more I thought about it, the more I just knew it had been Oatmeal. That cat always causes problems. At night he either fights things that can’t fight back, like the couch or the cabinets or the laundry baskets downstairs, or he sits in the upstairs hallway and howls, trying to get into our rooms to show off the socks he hunts and kills. He’s annoying, which means he’s Miranda’s perfect pet.

“Hey, Bozo.” Miranda came out of her room dressed in high-tops and a red polka-dot dress. She had some bracelets on, which, plus the dress, made her look kind of like a girl, except that her bracelets had skulls on them and her sneakers were black.

She was a weird sister. She was in sixth grade and I was in fourth. I didn’t understand why she didn’t dress normally. Everything had to have something black or bone-y in it.

“Your stupid cat got me in trouble, Miranda.”

“Maybe if you hadn’t set precedent so many times, you wouldn’t get blamed for wrecking the house.”

“I didn’t set president!” I didn’t even know what that word meant.

“Precedent, dummy. And yes you did, every time you played ball or some other stupid game in the house.” She walked past me and petted Oatmeal as he slithered toward her door. “Hurry up, or I’ll eat all the cereal.”

I didn’t hurry up. I put on my shoes and was silently thankful that she hadn’t noticed my messy hair. I walked back downstairs with heavy feet, and let my backpack hit the steps behind me.

Dad was eating his burned toast with honey, and trying to mop up a gloppy mess on the floor. He did not look happy. Miranda was at the table eating a bowl of Kix. She threw one at me. I decided to skip cereal.

“Daniel, this is unacceptable,” Dad muttered.

“Dad, it was Oatmeal. He went on a night rampage and did this.”

“MIRANDA!” Dad raised his voice.

“Dad, he’s just being a cat. He has wild instincts.” Miranda didn’t even lift her head.

“You need to start keeping your cookie things in the pantry.”

“They look good in the jars.”

“Fine. They’ll just have to look good in the jars in the pantry.”

Miranda decided not to argue, I guess, because she shut up. Dad was struggling. The paper towels he was using to wipe up the wet flour weren’t doing a good job. He threw two handfuls in the trash, but there were still smears of paste on the ground and some dry flour powdering the corners of the kitchen. Dad looked at the clock on the stove, and he said, “Look at the time! We have to go.” Then he rushed to the laundry room to put on a work shirt.

“Get your school stuff together and get in the car,” Dad said. He huffed his way out the door. Miranda got up and went back upstairs, leaving me in the kitchen by myself. I sidestepped the sticky streaks of flour on the ground and got a Popsicle from the freezer. Breakfast!

When I got outside, Dad was already waiting in the driveway. I got in the front seat (take that, Miranda!) and noticed some crusty flour on the back of his work jacket. I didn’t say anything. He’d probably just get mad. He was already mad anyway and getting angrier, as he impatiently honked the horn for Miranda. She shuffled out the front door, holding her lumpy backpack in front of her with both arms. We pulled out and Dad turned on NPR.

“I hope you two packed lunch.”

“I forgot,” I said. “Can I have some money?”

“Here, take 10 bucks.” Dad tossed his wallet into my lap. I looked back at Miranda. I was kind of disappointed that she hadn’t gotten mad about me sitting in the front seat.

“Miranda, do you need money, too?” Dad asked.

“No.”

“What did you bring for lunch?”

“Oatmeal.”

“That’s gross, weirdo.” Who eats oatmeal for lunch, I thought.

“If you say so, kiddo.” Dad rolled his eyes. “I hope you packed the instant stuff, because if you cooked oatmeal just now, it’s going to get really cold and nasty, and I’m going to be really annoyed that you wasted time doing that while we were waiting outside for you.”

Miranda just looked out the window. We didn’t talk for a few minutes, and the radio droned on about the news.

“Yeah, we waited forever,” I said, turning around to glare. When I did, I noticed something weird. Miranda’s backpack moved. I opened my mouth to say something but Miranda made a mean face and mouthed, “Don’t say anything.”

A little white paw poked out from under the flap on her bag. I turned around again. Unbelievable! How is it that I was the one who always got in trouble for what that cat did? Miranda was worse than I was!

Dad pulled up to our school. “Have a good day, guys,” he said, and I still didn’t tell him about the flour-paste on his coat.

I got out; Miranda didn’t. I stood on the sidewalk for a moment wondering why she was just sitting there. And then I saw Oatmeal squeeze his way out of her bag, despite her struggle to keep him contained. I slammed the door shut so he wouldn’t escape. I heard her shriek and my dad yell, while I watched the cat tear the leather as he clawed his way under the passenger seat.

“MIRANDA!!!” Dad’s scream was muffled with all the doors closed. I could hear them arguing, and then Dad waved at me without looking and drove away.

I probably should have felt a little angry that Miranda got to be late to school, or that my dad just drove away like that. But as I walked into the building, I just could not stop smiling.

"
Respecting the Flag,"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”

 

Important Things to Remember

The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag should be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. If not in uniform, a person should remove his or her hat with the right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, with the hand over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute.

Display the U.S. flag every day, but especially on national and state holidays. On Memorial Day, the flag should be flown at half-staff in the forenoon (sunrise until noon), then raised to its normal position at the top of the staff. When raising the flag to half-staff, first raise it to the top of the staff, then lower it half-way. When lowering a flag that has been flying at half-staff, first raise it to the top of the staff, then lower it all the way. The U.S. flag should be displayed on or near the main building of every public institution, in or near every school on school days, and in or near every polling place on election days. Always hoist the U.S. flag briskly. Lower it slowly and ceremoniously.

 

Things Not to Do

Never show disrespect to the U.S. flag. Never dip (lower quickly and then raise) the U.S. flag to any person or thing. Regimental colors, state flags and organization or institutional flags are dipped as a mark of honor. Never display the U.S. flag with the field of stars at the bottom, except as a distress signal. Never let the U.S. flag touch anything beneath it — ground, floor, water or merchandise. Never carry the U.S. flag horizontally, but always aloft and free.

Always allow the U.S. flag to fall free — never use the U.S. flag as drapery, festooned, drawn back or up in folds. For draping platforms and decoration in general, use blue, white and red bunting. Always arrange the bunting with blue above, the white in the middle and the red below. Never fasten, display, use or store the U.S. flag in a manner that will permit it to be easily torn, soiled or damaged in any way. Never use the U.S. flag as a covering or drape for a ceiling. Never place anything on the U.S. flag and never have placed upon it, or on any part of it, or attached to it, any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture or drawing of any nature.The U.S. flag should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, and the like; printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discarded; or used as any portion of a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, fire fighters, police officers and members of patriotic organizations. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff from which the flag is flown."
'My Life Hasn't Changed',"On a cold morning in Austria, 16-year-old skier Ann Thompson was about to make her last practice run before lunch.

At the time, Thompson was one of the United States' top junior skiers. She hoped to win an Olympic gold medal in skiing.

As she prepared for that practice run, she couldn't know that it would be the last one she'd ever take.

As she sped down the hill on her skis, Thompson had a terrible accident. She fell and severed her spinal cord.

The spinal cord is made of tissue that carries signals to and from the brain. They tell body parts when and how to move.

Thompson's fall took place in August 1985. As a result of the accident, Thompson could no longer walk. Her skiing career was over. But her life as an athlete was not.

'I Never Missed a Beat'
""The accident didn't change anything,"" Thompson told Extra. ""I never missed a beat. I'm the same person I was before.""

After her accident, Thompson joined the Cruisers, a program for wheelchair athletes in Connecticut, Thompson's home state.

""We brought her down to see what was happening,"" said Don Chaffee, a Cruiser official. ""At first, she said, 'I can't do that.' Then she realized, 'I can do that. I'm going to do that.' And we're so proud of her.""

Paralympic Star
Just over a year after her accident, Thompson was a top wheelchair athlete. Her sport was track and field.

As a student at the University of Illinois, Thompson also played basketball. It wasn't easy for her. She had never played basketball before her accident. Now she was learning the sport in a wheelchair.

""I started practice in October of my freshman year,"" she said. ""I made my first basket right before Christmas break.""

Thompson also joined the U.S. Paralympic team. In 1988, 1992, and 1996, she competed in track-and-field events. She won two gold medals, a silver medal, and two bronze medals.

From Track to Hoops
Soon, though, Thompson knew she had to get a job. She knew that training for track and field took too much time to allow her to work. So she tried out for the U.S. Paralympic women's basketball team instead, and she made it.

Thompson played basketball at the Paralympic Games in Sydney, Australia, in October 2000. Her husband, a U.S. team trainer, went to Australia with her.

Role Model
Thompson is a role model for millions of people with physical disabilities. Her message to kids is simple. ""Try,"" she said. ""Really try. If you want to do something, give it your best effort. If you really want to do something, you can find a way to do it.""

The kids who have watched her practice see her as proof that anything is possible.

""They see this lady in her wheelchair going around, getting married, and loving life,"" said Chaffee. ""And they say, 'Hey, I can make it, too.'"""
